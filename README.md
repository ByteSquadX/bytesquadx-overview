# ByteSquadX – Production-Grade Multi-Agent AI Platform (Overview)

⚠️ **Important Note**
This repository is a **public overview** of the ByteSquadX platform.
The full production implementation, source code, and internal workflows are maintained in a **private repository**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

ByteSquadX is a production-grade AI platform designed to orchestrate autonomous AI agents capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows in real-world environments.

The system focuses on reliability, scalability, and real-time intelligence rather than experimental or demo-only AI models.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- Multi-agent orchestration with task handoff and dependency tracking
- Memory-aware agent workflows with context persistence
- Prompt chaining and intelligent execution pipelines
- Tool and function calling with structured inputs/outputs
- Agent lifecycle management (creation, execution, evolution)
- Real-time system monitoring and dashboards

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

- **Frontend**
  - Real-time dashboards for agents, tasks, and system state
  - Built with modern React-based UI architecture

- **Backend**
  - Python-based API services
  - Event-driven execution and agent coordination
  - Modular service design for scalability

- **AI Layer**
  - Large Language Model (LLM) integrations
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Embeddings and vector search
  - Intelligent model routing with fallback logic

- **Infrastructure**
  - Cloud-native deployment
  - CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and delivery
  - Secure environment configuration and access control

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Representative)

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** React, modern state management
- **AI/ML:** LLMs, RAG, embeddings, prompt engineering
